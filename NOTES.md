# Notes so far:

# Completed:
Charts create dynamically. ✅ 
Calling the same chart updates dynamically. ✅ 
Created MCP (Not yet integrated). ✅ 
Created concepts of cashflow, initial balance and customer (All visible to chat). ✅ 
Able to analyse existing records. ✅ 
Integrate MCP server and ensure recognised in Agent State. ✅

Next steps:

Selecting invoices to pay (Could be short ones). ✅*
Testing editing records (Payment Date) through chat (And seeing the graphs change).
Updates (E.g. update all debtors where payment is due within 3 days, email analysis if possible).
Authorisation on low payment amounts?
Add way more charts.
Improve UX.
